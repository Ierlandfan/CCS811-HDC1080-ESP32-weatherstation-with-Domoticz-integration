# CCS811-HDC1080-ESP32-weatherstation-with-Domoticz-integration
IOT ESP32 weather station with CO2 &amp; VOC alarm and sends values to Domoticz. 
Can be used without display as well. 
Based on this nice Weatherstation made by Vortecks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9sn_d-Q3Ww .
I just added the Domoticz integration. 
Can easily be adapter for MQQT integration or other Domotica solution.
